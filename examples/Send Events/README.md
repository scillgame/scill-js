# Send Event

This is a basic example showing sending events using NodeJS.

First install dependencies in the root folder:
```
npm install
```

Then, build the libraries with:
```
npm run build
```

This creates a `dist` folder with the compiled JS files.

After that, cd into the example folder and run the sample with Node
```
cd examples/Send\ Events
node index.js
```

You should see this:
```
Sending event:  { message: 'OK', status: 200 }
```
